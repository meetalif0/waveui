# Contribution Guidelines

This guide will guide you how to become a WaveUI member, if you want to raise an issue or pull request, take a few minutes to read this guide.

### Version Adaptation

Based on the continuous iteration of the new version of Flutter, the WaveUI adaptation will be relatively lagging behind. If you have an adaptation request, you can raise [issue](https://github.com/LianjiaTech/waveui/issues/new) to us, we try our best to meet your needs.

### Branch management

We have maintained multiple branches `master` and the adaptation branch based on the Flutter SDK for a long time. In order to more clearly correspond to the version of the Flutter SDK, we named the branch after the version of the Flutter SDK. For example, the name of the branch adapted to Flutter SDK 2.2.2 is 2.2.2. If you want to fix a bug, please send [pull request](https://github.com/LianjiaTech/waveui/pulls) to the corresponding SDK branch, and we will decide whether to merge to other branches according to the situation.
